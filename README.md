# Title

# Abstract: 
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?


On September 11, 2001, terrorist hijacked two planes into One and Two World Trade Center. In the space of two hours, the tower collapse. Nearly 2800 people died this day. This event marks the beginning of the war opposing the United States and terrorism. Recognizing cinema as mirror of society, our motivation is to explore how traumatic, world-altering events, like 9/11, influence storytelling in film, particularly in terms of themes of security, nationalism, fear, and resilience. Based on this assumption, we aim to identify shifts in genre preferences, character archetypes and plot structure. Our goal is to tell the story on how cinema is defined by the culture identity and the collective trauma. More importantly, we want to show how cinema evolves in response a pivotal event: 9/11. 
Our project is based on the analysis of racism and terrorism representation in the US production compared to the rest of the world before and after 9/11. 

# Research Questions: 
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
Questions: 
•	What is the impact on racism of 9/11? Do we observe an increase in African ethnicity on actor representation? What ‘s their role, how are they describe? On a similar aspect, 9/11 attacks were claimed by Al-Qaeda, a group of extreme radicalized Muslims terrorist. Did it have an impact on the Muslim representation in movies?  
•	Cinema is often considered as a mirror of society. Therefore, was there an impact of 9/11 on cinema production, most importantly do we observe a shift in genre compared to the previous decade?
•	Do movies talking about war were more attractive before or after 9/11, did it have an impact? Does the representation of war increase?  
•	We assume the impact of 9/11 was greater in the United States compared to the rest of the world. But can we find other places where it had a great impact too on cinema? Those these places are known to have close relation with United States, or were they victim of similar attacks at the same time? 
•	Did this breakthrough event slow the cinema industry or on the contrary did we observe an increase?


# Additional datasets (if any): 
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

# Methods

## Preprocessing 

We'll start by performing necessary preprocessing steps, including:

- Discarding outliers
- Imputing missing values
- Creating more meaningful columns
- Transforming data types

We'll save the preprocessed datasets in our data folder.

## Analysis 
To investigate the impact of the 9/11 incident on the movie industry, we'll analyze our cleaned movie dataset in several ways:

### Discrimination Analysis
We'll examine if there's a noticeable difference in the representation of ethnicities of actors and villains in movies before and after 9/11, specifically looking for signs of racism and/or islamophobia.

### Genre Proportions Analysis
We'll compare the proportions of films in different genres, particularly the war genre, to see if there's a change in the number of films produced after 9/11.

### Plot Summary Analysis
We'll analyze the vocabulary in plot summaries to see if there's a difference in the frequency of words related to 9/11, such as terrorism, towers, and plane. We may use NLP models to quantify the differences.

### US vs. WRLD Analysis
We'll compare the impact of 9/11 on the US movie industry with its impact on the rest of the world, examining which regions were more or less affected.
