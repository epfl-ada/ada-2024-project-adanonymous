# Title

# Abstract: 
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
On September 11, 2001, terrorist hijacked two planes into One and Two World Trade Center. In the space of two hours, the tower collapse. Nearly 2800 people died this day. This event marks the beginning of the war opposing the United States and terrorism. Recognizing cinema as mirror of society, our motivation is to explore how traumatic, world-altering events, like 9/11, influence storytelling in film, particularly in terms of themes of security, nationalism, fear, and resilience. Based on this assumption, we aim to identify shifts in genre preferences, character archetypes and plot structure. Our goal is to tell the story on how cinema is defined by the culture identity and the collective trauma. More importantly, we want to show how cinema evolves in response a pivotal event: 9/11.
