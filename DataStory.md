Imagine you’re relaxing on your sofa, ready to watch an old movie from the 1940s. Out of curiosity, you type "best movie 1942" into Google — the year of your grandfather's birth. To your surprise, the top three highest-rated films from that year, according to IMDb, are about crime and death.

This sparks your interest: could it be a coincidence, or was there a broader trend in movie genres at that time?

To investigate, you look at the percentage of film genres with significant variation in a five-year range before and after 1942. The results reveal that genres like war films, propaganda films, and combat films increased in their occurence in the cinema. The data even highlights a peak, reflecting a rise in these types of films around this period.

Considering that World War II took place from 1939 to 1945, it becomes linked that the war influenced cinematic themes. The shift in genres appears to have started around 1940 and continued until around 1948.
You want to understand this trend a bit more, so you decide to focus on the "war film" genre across each of the main included continents: North America, Europe, and Asia.

In 1943, war films represented more than 11% of films in Europe — a percentage that had doubled compared to 1941. A similar doubling occurred in the United States, while Asia experienced a significant increase as well. By 1946, the percentage of war films in all three continents had nearly returned to its original level.
Looking further back, an earlier peak is noticeable in Asia in 1938 and 1939, which is not observed in Europe or the United States. Intrigued by this anomaly, you consult a history book and discover a possible explanation: the Second Sino-Japanese War, which began in 1937 and ended in 1945. The start of this conflict may have induced the initial surge in war films in Asia.

Plot  : graph plot of genre evolution by US vs NON us 
If we focus on some genre trends around 2001, shifts can be observed in genres such as social issues, political cinema, law and crime, and culture and society.

Among these, political cinema seems to have an important change . To better understand this shift, we apply a linear regression to analyze the overall trend before and after 2001. Furthermore, we separate the analysis into U.S. and non-U.S. movies to determine whether the change is a global phenomenon or specific to the U.S.

The analysis shows that, for U.S. movies, the percentage of political cinema is relatively constant before 2001 but shows an upward trend afterward. In contrast, for non-U.S. movies, no significant change in the trend is observed. This suggests that the shift is primarily driven by an event within the U.S. and more probably the 09/11 crisis.

If this shift is linked to the events of 9/11, we want to know whether the trend is consistent for non-U.S. regions. To do so, we focus on three key regions: Europe, Asia, and North America.

Starting from 2001, there is a noticeable emergence of the political cinema genre in Asia, where it was previously absent. In Europe, we observe a small increase in the genre's presence, less pronounced than the significant rise seen in the U.S.
This suggests that while the impact of 9/11 on political cinema is most evident in the U.S., its influence can also be seen, to a lesser extent, in other regions, particularly in Asia. Some cofounders might also be under the change in the other continents.
